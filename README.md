# `gactk` - Generative Art Creators Toolkit

`gactk` is a rust grate that aims to provide several feature rich utilities for creating generative art. This is a very primitive port of [`gactk` for Typescript](https://github.com/bupedev/gactk-ts) and may replace it over time. Ultimately this is library is a tool to help me (@bupedev) to write better Rust code while creating reusable modules for my generative art.
